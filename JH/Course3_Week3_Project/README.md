##Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data - Week 3 - Course Project
The objective of this R script is to create a tidy dataset as requested in the Course Project of the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data - Week 3.

The data derives from the Samsung's devices sensors and can be found at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.

A description about the raw data can be found at: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

A short description about the steps to create the tidy dataset are:
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

To run the R script, execute the function run_analysis(). This functions expects that the raw data resides in a folder inside your working directory, called "UCI HAR Dataset".

The R script is commented for a better understanding. Below are some steps of the algorithm.
* read all files that will be used
* merge the test dataset into 1 data set
* merge the train dataset into 1 data set
* merge the test and train datasets
* extract only the mean and std measurments
* rename the columns
* add the corresponding activity names
* average each value grouped by activity and subject
* write the data to disk

For more information about the final variables, please read the Code Book.
